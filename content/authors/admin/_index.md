Hi there, I am Rakshit.  I am an undergraduate student at Cambridge University.  I am majoring in Information Engineering.  I worked as a software intern at Fifthrow Tech in London where I helped to develop and deploy APIs, and built models to analyse customer data and twitter bots.  I love learning new technologies and have worked on various projects including text generation using LSTMs, creating human like voice using CNNs, and image generation using GANs. In my free time I love a game of chess or cooking a good meal.
